**Welcome** ðŸ‘‹, here I document my quest to:
- Automate my life and all of the devices around me
- Have a convenient interface to everything I would want
- Improve my decision-making by augmenting it with software and AI
- Log and reflect on everything that happens with me, my devices, and the environment around me

Graph of apps I set up to accomplish this:

**[ha-react-dashboard](https://github.com/yep-dev/ha-react-dashboard)** â€“ custom UI I wrote in React to Home Assistant and other services

**[appdaemon](https://github.com/yep-dev/appdaemon)** â€“ HA automation engine in Python with my heavy customizations for ease of use and some of my automation code
